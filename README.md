# SportsHunt_using_Spring_Framework - [Download Project](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HXtRPU0kyw-25cNdAGO0dqF5zPJfqDYw). 
It's my MCA 6th semester project based on JAVA platform using Spring Framework and mysql.  Nowadays, due to overwhelming of the number of tournaments management held in clubs, most
organizers experiencing difficulties to manage and retrieve the required information. This project
can reduce the various difficulties likes finding the team and their information etc, rather than this
project can connect organizer and other club members as well. The purpose of this project is to
improve tournament management using Sports Tournament Management System (SportsHunt). Not
only sports tournament, organizers also can create various types of events like a Blood donation
camp, Clothes Distribution to poor families etc. Tournamentâ€™s organizer is able to manage
information such as teams, events etc. This system will be developed on the Java platform and
MySQL as data storage for web application. Both sides (Tournament organizer(club), another club,
and sponsors) can communicate with in real time communicate with chat application.
